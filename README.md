# Introduction
Pics-Art is my final project during Ironhack bootcamp in Paris.
I wanted to re-create in a week a MVP of an Instagram-like social network with a "mobile first" interface" (so I recommend you to re-size your window to have a better display of the interface).

I used "MERN" stack and Material UI as well.
